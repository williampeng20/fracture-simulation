    <h2 align="center">Abstract</h2>

      <p>We designed and implemented a fracture simulation that models the effect of rigid body collision on glass. The goal was
      to create a realistic model while simultaneously minimizing the required algorithmic complexity for this process. We accomplished
      this by carefully designing our data structures and fine-tuning our heuristics to minimize approximation error. We worked
      with Blender and its Python API to support scripting the behavior of its scene objects. We were able to put together a glass-shattering
      simulation that can react to different forces and different initial points of impact. </p>

    <br>

    <h2 align="center">Technical Approach</h2>

      <p>Describe blender and stuff here...</p>

      <p>Our approach at a high level can be broken down into a few key steps. Given two Blender objects, one representing our glass pane
      and representing our stressor, we first need to determine the force of this impact and the impact location. Next, we precompute
      how the glass pane will fracture as a result. This should involve generating new Blender objects representing each glass shard and
      and removing the original glass pane object. Lastly, we want to appropriately apply physics to each shard object separately at the
      right time.</p>

      <br>
      <h3 align="center">Detecting Contact Point and Force</h3>
      <br>

      <p>The first step is simple as we only need to compute our impact location and contact force exerted onto the glass plane. Our impact
        location, vec_p, can be computed using linear algebra in 3-dimensional space. If we let vec_o be the origin of our stressor and vec_d
        be the the direction of its travel. We know that, for some vec_p_prime being any point on the plane and vec_n being the normal to our
        glass plane, then (vec_p - vec_p_prime) dot vec_n = 0 by the definition of a plane. We know that as long as the stressor is moving in
        the direction of our plane, then vec_o + t * vec_d must be equal to vec_p for some real and non-negative value t. Therefore, letting
        vec_o + t * vec_d = vec_p, substituting into our plane equation and solving for t, we get
        vec_p = vec_o + vec_d * ((vec_p_prime - vec_o) dot vec_n) / (vec_d dot vec_n).Next, we comput the force as f = ma. We are now ready to
        ass contact force and contact point as parameters to our fracture generation function.The values m and a are specified as inputs. </p>

      <h3 align="center">Researching Fracturing</h3>
      <br>

      <p>We wanted to implement a fracturing algorithm that yielded realistic results so we read several research papers describing mostly high-level
        ideas on how this could be implemented. The paper that had the most influence on our initial design, titled dlkafldf, aimed to reduce the typical
        visual uniformity that results from attempts to model fracturing by introducing extra randomness in its heuristics and its underlying data structures.
        Our team agreed that we would wish to minimize uniformity in our results since fracturing should appear as a perceivably mostly random process. The
        paper suggested representing fracturable objects with an underlying mesh of particles similar to a pile of marbles glued together. Each adjacent pair
        of particles has a bond strength which can be weakened by contact forces. After this strength dips below a specified threshold, the particles are considered
        broken apart. When contiguous areas are broken off, shards begin to form. Randomness is inforced by requiring that a contact force be passed along particle to
        particle in a randomly selected direction with the force growing weaker through each particle. After considering this approach, we concluded that
        although this would deliver desirable results, we could refactor and simplify the algorithm and underlying data structures since we are only considering
        simulation for a thing glass plane. As a result, we could work in 2-dimensional space and extrapolate to 3-dimensional space with little error, allowing us
        to not need to use a 3-dimensional particle-mesh representation. </p>

        <p>We then considered just using a 2-dimensional version of the particle mesh; however, we believed that we could further simplify the design without
        losing any realism. The main idea was that we could maintain realism by finding a new way to introduce randomness into our model with carefully designed
        heuristics. We researched Vornoi fracturing patterns which use a set of randomized reference points to construct realistic shard shapes. This gave us the
        idea of maintaining our randomness by randomizing the locations of our particles in the mesh and instead of needing to calculate breaking points by linearly
        traversing adjacent particles, we could now use these random particle positions as garunteed breaking point references which essentially reduces the complexity
        of the process. The realism of this method would then come down to how we connected the particles (ie. decided where our fracture lines were), deciding
        on a pdf for randomly sampling our particle points and what sample rate to use. </p>

        <br>
        <h3 align="center">Particle Sampling Algorithm</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Our goal for our particle distribution was to have the majority of the points clustered at the the contact point and be distributed roughly evenly at any
          given radius going outward in all directions. We sampled two random values using Python's random.uniform(low, high) function. We sampled a theta value
          between 0 and 2pi representing the direction originating at the contact point and a radius value between 0 and 1. To bias our points towards the contact point,
          we used a pdf of x^9. Our final sampled point is contact_point + Vector(cos(theat), sin(theta), contact_point.z) * radius * max(pan height, pane width) * impact_force / k
          for some dampening constant k. In order to only sample points on the glass pane, we simply reject and recompute and samples out of bounds. The number of points we
          compute is also proportional to the impact force which is impact_force * alpha for some constant alpha. </p>

        <br>
        <h3 align="center">Computing Fracturing</h3>
        <br>
        <p>We now wish to form shards out of these particles using them as vertices for our shard shapes. We aim to connect them in a way that appears like a vague ripple effect
        coming out of the contact point center while minimizing the complexity in determining the locations and boundaries of each shard and preventing overlap or gaps. Since the
        particles are alraedy scattered randomly, we can utilize heuristics for shard approximation to minimize complexity without sacrificing realism. Given our total particle
        sample set, we compute two subsets: the inner set and the outer set. The inner set is computed as points belonging to the convex hull of our entire sample set using
        Jarvis's March algorithm efficiently in O(nlogn) time. We then comopute random points along the edges of the pane using linear interpolation between the corners. The cardinality
        of this edge set is directly proportional to the intial size of our inner set. We then let the larger of these two sets be the primary set and the smaller be the secondary set. For
        each </p>

    <h2 align="center">Results</h2>
    <br>
    <p>In the end, we were able to both preemptively calculate fracture lines and vertices, as well as apply rigid body physics to each new fragment accurately in order to portray them in a Blender simulation. 
    While we were only able to simulate glass material, but using the Voronoi cell fracturing method, we were able to replicate fracturing behavior in this material quite well, both independently and with rigid body collision.
